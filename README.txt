Noughts and Crosses!

Or, tic-tac-toe. 

This Jupyter notebook is inspired from one of the assessments I did for my master's, which was to implement an AI agent that can intelligently play noughts and crosses. It does this by using the minimax algorithm. 

The function that implements the AI is score, which recursively calls itself in order to create a tree. 

At the end I created two functions - one that automates play between two computer agents, and one that allows the user to play against the computer. I haven't been able to beat the computer yet! I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing.
